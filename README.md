# Lottery-Smart-Contract
practice

Lottery Contract allows the players to register to play the lottery game by tajing some ether. 
The person who deployed the smart contract is the manager and he calls a function on the contract to pick a random winner.
The random winner chosen will be awarded all the ether deposited on the contract from several players.
The contract resets itself for the next round.
